tunis;"Illness has three definitions. Two of them are of the way the word was used up to the 18th century—to mean either “wickedness, depravity, immorality”, or “unpleasantness, disagreeableness, hurtfulness”. These older meanings reflect the fact that the word “ill” is a contracted form of “evil”. The third meaning, dating from the 17th century, is the modern one: “Ill health; the state of being ill”";true;"""01/01/2019"""
tunis;There is a rather unhelpful circularity about these dictionary definitions. But dictionaries of the English language usually only aim to tell us the origins of words and how they have been used historically. They do not aim at the much more contestable goal of conceptual clarity. ;true;"""01/01/2019"""
tunis;Disease then, is the pathological process, deviation from a biological norm. Illness is the patient's experience of ill health, sometimes when no disease can be found. ;true;"""01/01/2019"""
tunis;I have leg injuries the doctor gave me a day certificate, in fact I am really damaged;true;"""01/01/2019"""
tunis; Most patients most of the time however, probably can be classified as having a disease, or feeling ill, or being recognised as sick.;true;"""01/01/2019"""
tunis;"So the reviewer, expounding Showalter, claims. People with ME and Gulf war veterans, by contrast, understandably might contest this view of what they are suffering from;";true;"""01/01/2019"""
sousse;I have leg injuries the doctor gave me a day certificate, in fact I am really damaged;true;"""01/01/2019"""
sousse;Some diseases, clearly, are less respectable than others. A classic example is Munchausen's syndrome, the diagnostic label applied to people who repeatedly present themselves to hospitals with convincing symptoms,;true;"""01/01/2019"""
sousse;But their condition is more likely to be dismissed as “a bizarre form of malingering;true;"""01/01/2019"""
sousse;Well perhaps, Hare suggests, we just use the word “disease” for “conditions whose cause was not visible before the invention of microscopes”. But a more basic point, ;true;"""01/01/2019"""
sousse;But what does “understand in medical terms” mean in this context? Does it mean that doctors hope to find some causative agent in the patient, or in the patient's environment;true;"""01/01/2019"""
sousse;At this point, of course, doctors might protest that theorising around an example like Munchausen's syndrome is more typical of philosophy than of more everyday medical practice, in which medical faith, seeking understanding, has repeatedly found it.;true;"""01/01/2019"""
sousse;When philosophers try to define health some of them reach a similar conclusion. R S Downie for example, agrees that the World Health Organisation definition of health;true;"""01/01/2019"""
sousse;The problem, however, is not just that ill health can be difficult to pin down. It is also that we normally think of health as having a positive as well as a negative dimension. But here again things are complicated. A positive feeling of wellbeing,;true;"""01/01/2019"""
gbelli;A positive feeling of wellbeing, for example, may not be enough. As Downie says: “it would be difficult to make a case for viewing an acute schizophrenic state with mood elevation and a blissful lack of insight as one of positive health”.;true;"""01/01/2019"""
gbelli;One reason then, why definitions of disease and health are sometimes so frustratingly elusive is the part played by value judgments in determining what we mean by disease and health as well as what we mean by illness and sickness. In many cases this is not obvious, because most people,;true;"""01/01/2019"""
gbelli; in our society at least, make the same or similar value judgments about what these words mean and what are examples of what they mean. There is, as it were, a common core of ideas about what disease is or what health is. ;true;"""01/01/2019"""
ariena; But beyond that common core, judgments on whether a condition is a disease, or on what or who is healthy, begin to diverge, and our conceptions of disease and health begin to get fuzzy.;true;"""01/01/2019"""
nabeul;Another way of understanding this, I think, has to do with the important part played by metaphor in the development of thought and language.;true;"""01/01/2019"""
